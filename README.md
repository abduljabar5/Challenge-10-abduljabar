## Discription
This project was a little tricky, but what kept me motivated was the little challenges i had to overcome to complete this project. The purpose of this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. this was interesting becuase this was the first time creating a test. during this project I learned a few things like how to add a link that opens in a new tab.
